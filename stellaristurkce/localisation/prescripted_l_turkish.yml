 EMPIRE_DESIGN_humans1:0 "Birleşmiş Dünya Milletleri"
 EMPIRE_DESIGN_humans1_desc:0 "Bu iki ayaklı memeliler bireysel özgürlüklerin ve kültürel farklılıkların özgürlüğünü destekleyen ve hatta büyüten bir topluluk kurdular - bunun sonucunda, İnsanlar uzaylı nüfusları ile kaynaşmaya eğilimliler.\n\nBuna rağmen, (kendi ana gezegenlerinde bir milenyum boyunca süren aralıklı savaşlar tarafından üretilmiş) güçlü bir askeri gelenekleri ile bazen agresif ve beklenmedik doğaları nedeniyle hafife alınmamaları gerekir."
 EMPIRE_DESIGN_humans2:0 "İnsanların Milletler Topluluğu"
 EMPIRE_DESIGN_humans2_desc:0 "Desteklenmemiş Ulysses Girişimcilik 21. yüzyıl sonlarında düşük Dünya yörüngesinde altı büyük ark gemisinin yapımını üstlendi. Gemiler güçlü ama dengesiz solucan deliği jeneratörleri ile döşenmiş ve her birinde çeyrek milyon kolonisti uzak yıldızlara doğru taşımaya gönderildi. Bir daha hiçbirinden haber alınamadı, ve alt uzay solucan delikleri araştırmalarından kısa zamanda vazgeçildi.\n\nYine de ark gemilerinden birisi, Dünya'dan habersizce bereketli bir uzaylı uydusuna varmayı ve gelişmekte olan bir koloni kurmayı başardı. Bu dünyayı evcilleştiren öncüler gün gibi ortada olan insanlığın kaderinden emindi - ne pahasına olursa olsun galaksiyi egemenlik altına almak."
 EMPIRE_DESIGN_tzynn:0 "Tzynn İmparatorluğu"
 EMPIRE_DESIGN_tzynn_desc:0 "The Tzynn evolved from carnivorous, pack-hunting lizards that prowled the dunes of Tzynnia. They eventually developed a highly structured, hierarchical society that emphasized order and martial prowess above all else.\n\nBy the time the Tzynn entered the industrial age, a series of devastating global wars launched by a particularly ruthless warlord had already seen the establishment of a single, world-spanning nation. From these humble beginnings, the illustrious and ever-lasting Tzynn Empire was born."
 EMPIRE_DESIGN_yondar:0 "Yondarim Krallığı"
 EMPIRE_DESIGN_yondar_desc:0 "The proud Yondar are an old race, using their wings to soar high above the steaming jungles of Yondarim for more than 200,000 years before they developed rudimentary technology and formed their first few scattered civilizations.\n\nOnce this development started, things progressed more rapidly and the Sky Clans grudgingly abandoned many of their most primitive traditions. The Yondar are highly spiritual and place great importance on religion, venerating their high kings as living gods."
 EMPIRE_DESIGN_ixidar:0 "Ix'Idar Yıldız Ortaklığı"
 EMPIRE_DESIGN_ixidar_desc:0 "The first Ix'Idar broods developed in the subterranean cave networks deep beneath the surface of Ix'Athrak. By the time an Ix'Idar scout burrowed through to the surface and glimpsed sunlight for the first time, the insectoid race had already established a thriving Iron Age civilization.\n\nWith the resources they found on the surface, the Ix'Idar developed rapidly. Just a few centuries later their first space probes left orbit to survey the other worlds within the Ix'Im system."
 EMPIRE_DESIGN_chinorr:0 "Chinorr Yıldızımsı Birliği"
 EMPIRE_DESIGN_chinorr_desc:0 "The Chinorr began their evolutionary journey as dexterous cephalopod analogues. They used their many tentacles to swing between trees in the lush jungles of Chicora, ambushing prey on the ground and injecting them with a potent nerve toxin.\n\nBy the time the Chinorr split the atom, the resources of Chicora had been ruthlessly exploited and the planet's jungles had long since disappeared. This was considered a necessary sacrifice in the relentless pursuit of knowledge and heavy industry that the unsentimental Chinorr were now engaged in."
 EMPIRE_DESIGN_jehetma:0 "Jehetma Dominyonu"
 EMPIRE_DESIGN_jehetma_desc:0 "An "individual" among the Jehetma is actually a large colony of fungi that has developed sentience. Some of these colonies, generally those that have lived for thousands of years, stretch across several miles and rarely leave the surface of Jehet Prime, their homeworld (few ships are large enough to transport them).\n\nYounger colonies are not only smaller, but also tend to be more dynamic and mobile - they often spearhead the exploration and research efforts of the Jehetma, as well as any defensive measures that are regrettably undertaken when the Dominion is beset by aggressors."
 EMPIRE_DESIGN_scyldari:0 "Scyldari Konfederasisi"
 EMPIRE_DESIGN_scyldari_desc:0 "The Scyldari are aquatic mammalians originating from the archipelagos and deep oceans of Scyldaria. Although their early civilizations were mostly confined to the sea, they soon expanded onto what little landmass the planet had to offer.\n\nTheir society adapted accordingly, building an advanced industry that exploited the riches of the ocean floor without harming Scyldaria's delicate ecosystem. Scyldari philosophy is one of balance and moderation in all things, a lesson learned from having to nurse their limited resources when they were confined to the bottom of the sea."
 EMPIRE_DESIGN_kel_azaan:0 "Gezegenler Arası Kel-Azaan İttifağı"
 EMPIRE_DESIGN_kel_azaan_desc:0 "These furry, cold-blooded mammalians have developed a complex honor code and martial culture. The Kel-Azaan were once solitary herbivores that journeyed from cave to cave across the icy wastes of Azak to feed off roots and lichen. To defend against predators, bands of Kel-Azaan gathered annually to hunt the hunters and keep the cave routes safe. They eventually abandoned this solitary lifestyle in favor of cities and subterranean agriculture, but their martial traditions were never forgotten."
 EMPIRE_DESIGN_paridni:0 "Paridni Ticari Cumhuriyeti"
 EMPIRE_DESIGN_paridni_desc:0 "Crustacean analogues, the Paridni are a species of enterprising traders. They are very accepting of other alien cultures, as long as those cultures aren't adverse to the cardinal tenet around which Paridni society revolves - commerce. The Shadow Council, a body of influential merchants, is charged with safeguarding trade within the Republic and opening up new markets (by force if necessary)."
